# New

What's new in this project and related projects in the major development work in 2025.

Although front end and server side is always actually reinventing exiting designments, things really become better in recent years.

And nearly every line of source code and every line of the documents is updated, include

- ECMA module import syntax widely accepted, makes mypack bundler module resolution part easier
- introduce of 'node:' url helps distinguish nodejs builtin packages and 3rd party libraries or relative modules
- my experience? and AI experience? let me design a bundler without function wrapper for each module
- my experience? of reading minified source code? let me discard the use of source map?
- react jsx runtime become formal and don't need manual handling
- node directly executing typescript files avoid the need of build script bootstrapping
- new remote akari communication protocol design simplifies build script architecture
- use of Let's Encrypt DNS-01 and split of certificates make certificate process more robust TODO use of wildcard certificate?
- use non-root user for server process make things more security?
- implementation of short link service make url sharing a lot more easier
- my experience? of OAuth2.0 and OIDC let me design a new SSO authentication schema
