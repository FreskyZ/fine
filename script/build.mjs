// this script builds the entire build script (aka akari)

// akari used to build self by self, but that's proved to be too complex and cause too many errors
// so use this standalone one-file non-typescript script instead, this script is called akari-build
// although one-file and non-typescript, akari-build still follow the design pattern to call typescript
// nodejs api and bundle on my own
