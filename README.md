Nianqinren's first personal website

A website with a few kind of useful web apps while mainly focus on

### DevOps
- mono repo with no various `tsconfig.xxx.json` and `webpack.config.xxx.js` config files but one unified build script
- what does `webpack`/`ts-loader`/`webpack-dev-server` (and many other familiar names) actually do and try to implement a full or subset of them
- deployment and maintenance process

### Isomorphic Web App
- what can be shared, what can be omitted
- how is it affecting devops
- comparing to isomerism web apps
