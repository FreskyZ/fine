### DevOps

- Use a unified build script to minimize configuration files, covering:
  - Bundlers: `webpack.config.js`, `vite.config.js`, etc.
  - Transpilers: `tsconfig.json`, `babel.config.json`, etc.
  - CSS: `postcss.config.js`
  - Formatting and linting: `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`, etc.
  - Testing: `jest.config.js`, `karma.conf.js`, etc.
- Gain a shallow understanding of internals of these tools and implement key components.
- Streamline development, deployment, and maintenance processes.

### Isomorphic Web App

> oh, no, the term "isomorphic" or "universal" web app nowadays refers to applications that run across multiple
> platforms and environments, such as browsers and mobile devices, and capable of rendering "universally" on both
> server and client side. However, this project was originally intended to experiment with using JavaScript on 
> both the server and client side, and use "traditional" front-end/back-end split without server-side rendering.

- JavaScript on both the browser and server (node.js).
- Explore the advantages, disadvantages, and differences between isomorphic web apps.
